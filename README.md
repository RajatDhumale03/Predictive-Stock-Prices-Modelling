Preprocessed S&P 500 index data to handle non-stationarity and outliers, and analyzed seasonality, trends, and autocorrelation
Developed a hybrid forecasting model by integrating ARIMA for capturing linear patterns and trends, and LSTM networks for modeling non-linear dependencies and intricate time series dynamics, resulting in enhanced predictive accuracy
Implemented a Gradio-based user interface to facilitate interactive testing and comparison of forecasting results with visualization
